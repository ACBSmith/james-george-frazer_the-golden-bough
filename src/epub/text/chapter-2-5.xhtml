					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in primitive society the rules of ceremonial purity observed by divine kings, chiefs, and priests agree in many respects with the rules observed by homicides, mourners, women in childbed, girls at puberty, hunters and fishermen, and so on. To us these various classes of persons appear to differ totally in character and condition; some of them we should call holy, others we might pronounce unclean and polluted. But the savage makes no such moral distinction between them; the conceptions of holiness and pollution are not yet differentiated in his mind. To him the common feature of all these persons is that they are dangerous and in danger, and the danger in which they stand and to which they expose others is what we should call spiritual or ghostly, and therefore imaginary. The danger, however, is not less real because it is imaginary; imagination acts upon man as really as does gravitation, and may kill him as certainly as a dose of prussic acid. To seclude these persons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded spiritual danger shall neither reach them, nor spread from them, is the object of the taboos which they have to observe. These taboos act, so to say, as electrical insulators to preserve the spiritual force with which these persons are charged from suffering or inflicting harm by contact with the outer world.<a href="#note_701" id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">701</span></span></a></p>

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the illustrations of these general principles which have been already given I shall now add some more, drawing my examples, first, from the class of tabooed things, and, second, from the class of tabooed words; for in the opinion of the savage both things and words may, like persons, be charged or electrified, either temporarily or permanently, with the mysterious virtue of taboo, and may therefore require to be banished for a longer or shorter time from the familiar usage of common life. And the examples will be chosen with special reference to those sacred chiefs, kings and priests, who, more than anybody else, live fenced about by taboo as by a wall. Tabooed things will be illustrated in the present chapter, and tabooed words in the next.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This superstitious objection to iron perhaps dates from that early time in the history of society when iron was still a novelty, and as such was viewed by many with suspicion and dislike.<a href="#note_732" id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> For everything new is apt to excite the awe and dread of the savage. <span class="tei tei-q">โIt is a curious superstition,โ</span> says a pioneer in Borneo, <span class="tei tei-q">โthis of the Dusuns, to attribute anythingโwhether good or bad, lucky or unluckyโthat happens to them to something novel which has arrived in their country.

From the summit of a pass he gazed with delight down a long valley which, stretching away as far as eye could reach to the south, resembled a sea of bloom, for everywhere the forest was ablaze with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg231" name="Pg231"/> gorgeous hues of the rhododendron and azalea in flower. In this earthly paradise the votary of science hastened to install himself beside a lake. But hardly had he done so when, alas! the weather changed. Though the season was early June, the cold became intense, snow fell heavily, and the bloom of the rhododendrons was cut off. The inhabitants of a neighbouring village at once set down the unusual severity of the weather to the presence of a stranger in the forest; and a round-robin, signed by them unanimously, was forwarded to the nearest mandarin, setting forth that the snow which had blocked the road, and the hail which was blasting their crops, were alike caused by the intruder, and that all sorts of disturbances would follow if he were allowed to remain. In these circumstances the naturalist, who had intended to spend most of the summer among the mountains, was forced to decamp. <span class="tei tei-q">โCollecting in this country,โ</span> he adds pathetically, <span class="tei tei-q">โis not an easy matter.โ</span><a href="#note_734" id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> The unusually heavy rains which happened to follow the English survey of the Nicobar Islands in the winter of 1886-1887 were imputed by the alarmed natives to the wrath of the spirits at the theodolites, dumpy-levellers, and other strange instruments which had been set up in so many of their favourite haunts; and some of them proposed to soothe the anger of the spirits by sacrificing a pig.<a href="#note_735" id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> When the German Hans Stade was a captive in a cannibal tribe of Brazilian Indians, it happened that, shortly before a prisoner was to be eaten, a great wind arose and blew away part of the roofs of the huts. The savages were angry with Stade, and said he had made the wind to come by looking into his thunder-skins, by which they meant a book he had been reading, in order to save the prisoner, who was a friend of his, from their stomachs. So the pious German prayed to God, and God mercifully heard his prayer; for next morning the weather was beautifully fine, and his friend was butchered, carved, and eaten in the most perfect comfort.<a href="#note_736" id="noteref_736" name="noteref_736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a> According to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg232" name="Pg232"/> Orotchis of eastern Siberia, misfortunes have multiplied on them with the coming of Europeans; <span class="tei tei-q">โthey even go so far as to lay the appearance of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new</span></em> phenomena like thunder at the door of the Russians.โ</span><a href="#note_737" id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a> In the seventeenth century a succession of bad seasons excited a revolt among the Esthonian peasantry, who traced the origin of the evil to a water-mill, which put a stream to some inconvenience by checking its flow.<a href="#note_738" id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> The first introduction of iron ploughshares into Poland having been followed by a succession of bad harvests, the farmers attributed the badness of the crops to the iron ploughshares, and discarded them for the old wooden ones.<a href="#note_739" id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a> To this day the primitive Baduwis of Java, who live chiefly by husbandry, will use no iron tools in tilling their fields.<a href="#note_740" id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a></p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general dislike of innovation, which always makes itself strongly felt in the sphere of religion, is sufficient by itself to account for the superstitious aversion to iron entertained by kings and priests and attributed by them to the gods; possibly this aversion may have been intensified in places by some such accidental cause as the series of bad seasons which cast discredit on iron ploughshares in Poland. But the disfavour in which iron is held by the gods and their ministers has another side. Their antipathy to the metal furnishes men with a weapon which may be turned against the spirits when occasion serves. As their dislike of iron is supposed to be so great that they will not approach persons and things protected by the obnoxious metal, iron may obviously be employed as a charm for banning ghosts and other dangerous spirits. And often it is so used. Thus in the Highlands of Scotland the great safeguard against the elfin race is iron, or, better yet, steel. The metal in any form, whether as a sword, a knife, a gun-barrel, or what not, is all-powerful for this purpose. Whenever you enter a fairy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg233" name="Pg233"/> dwelling you should always remember to stick a piece of steel, such as a knife, a needle, or a fish-hook, in the door; for then the elves will not be able to shut the door till you come out again. So too when you have shot a deer and are bringing it home at night, be sure to thrust a knife into the carcase, for that keeps the fairies from laying their weight on it. A knife or a nail in your pocket is quite enough to prevent the fairies from lifting you up at night. Nails in the front of a bed ward off elves from women <span class="tei tei-q">โin the strawโ</span> and from their babes; but to make quite sure it is better to put the smoothing-iron under the bed, and the reaping-hook in the window.

In New Zealand anything upon which even a drop of a high chief's blood chances to fall becomes taboo or sacred to him. For instance, a party of natives having come to visit a chief in a fine new canoe, the chief got into it, but in doing so a splinter entered his foot, and the blood trickled on the canoe, which at once became sacred to him. The owner jumped out, dragged the canoe ashore opposite the chief's house, and left it there. Again, a chief in entering a missionary's house knocked his head against a beam, and the blood flowed. The natives said that in former times the house would have belonged to the chief.<a href="#note_829" id="noteref_829" name="noteref_829"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a> As usually happens with taboos of universal application, the prohibition to spill the blood of a tribesman on the ground applies with peculiar stringency to chiefs and kings, and is observed in their case long after it has ceased to be observed in the case of others.</p>

It has been shewn that plants are considered as animate beings which bleed when cut, the red juice which exudes from some of them being regarded as the blood of the plant.<a href="#note_831" id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a> The juice of the grape is therefore naturally conceived as the blood of the vine.<a href="#note_832" id="noteref_832" name="noteref_832"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> And since, as we have just seen, the soul is often believed to be in the blood, the juice of the grape is regarded as the soul, or as containing the soul, of the vine. This belief is strengthened by the intoxicating effects of wine. For, according to primitive notions, all abnormal mental states, such as intoxication or madness, are caused by the entrance of a spirit into the person; such mental states, in other words, are accounted forms of possession or inspiration. Wine, therefore, is considered on two distinct grounds as a spirit, or containing a spirit; first because, as a red juice, it is identified with the blood of the plant, and second because it intoxicates or inspires. Therefore if the Flamen Dialis had walked under a trellised vine, the spirit of the vine, embodied in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg249" name="Pg249"/> clusters of grapes, would have been immediately over his head and might have touched it, which for a person like him in a state of permanent taboo<a href="#note_833" id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> would have been highly dangerous. This interpretation of the prohibition will be made probable if we can shew, first, that wine has been actually viewed by some peoples as blood, and intoxication as inspiration produced by drinking the blood; and, second, that it is often considered dangerous, especially for tabooed persons, to have either blood or a living person over their heads.</p>

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the first point, we are informed by Plutarch that of old the Egyptian kings neither drank wine nor offered it in libations to the gods, because they held it to be the blood of beings who had once fought against the gods, the vine having sprung from their rotting bodies; and the frenzy of intoxication was explained by the supposition that the drunken man was filled with the blood of the enemies of the gods.<a href="#note_834" id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a> The Aztecs regarded <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pulque</span></span> or the wine of the country as bad, on account of the wild deeds which men did under its influence. But these wild deeds were believed to be the acts, not of the drunken man, but of the wine-god by whom he was possessed and inspired; and so seriously was this theory of inspiration held that if any one spoke ill of or insulted a tipsy man, he was liable to be punished for disrespect to the wine-god incarnate in his votary. Hence, says Sahagun, it was believed, not without ground, that the Indians intoxicated themselves on purpose to commit with impunity crimes for which they would certainly have been punished if they had committed them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg250" name="Pg250"/> sober.<a href="#note_835" id="noteref_835" name="noteref_835"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a> Thus it appears that on the primitive view intoxication or the inspiration produced by wine is exactly parallel to the inspiration produced by drinking the blood of animals.<a href="#note_836" id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a> The soul or life is in the blood, and wine is the blood of the vine.

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the reason for not passing under dangerous objects, like a vine or women's blood, is a fear that they may come in contact with the head; for among many peoples the head is peculiarly sacred. The special sanctity attributed to it is sometimes explained by a belief that it is the seat of a spirit which is very sensitive to injury or disrespect. Thus the Yorubas of the Slave Coast hold that every man has three spiritual inmates, of whom the first, called Olori, dwells in the head and is the man's protector, guardian, and guide. Offerings are made to this spirit, chiefly of fowls, and some of the blood mixed with palm-oil is rubbed on the forehead.<a href="#note_850" id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> The Karens of Burma suppose that a being called the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tso</span></span> resides in the upper part of the head, and while it retains its seat no harm can befall the person from the efforts of the seven <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Kelahs</span></span>, or personified passions. <span class="tei tei-q">โBut if the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tso</span></span> becomes heedless or weak certain evil to the person is the result.

The spirit must be carefully protected from injury of every kind; hence the act of shaving or cutting the hair is accompanied with many ceremonies. The <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span> is very sensitive on points of honour, and would feel mortally insulted if the head in which he resides were touched by the hand of a stranger. When Dr. Bastian, in conversation with a brother of the king of Siam, raised his hand to touch the prince's skull in order to illustrate some medical remarks he was making, a sullen and threatening murmur bursting from the lips of the crouching <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg253" name="Pg253"/> courtiers warned him of the breach of etiquette he had committed, for in Siam there is no greater insult to a man of rank than to touch his head. If a Siamese touch the head of another with his foot, both of them must build chapels to the earth-spirit to avert the omen. Nor does the guardian spirit of the head like to have the hair washed too often; it might injure or incommode him. It was a grand solemnity when the king of Burma's head was washed with water drawn from the middle of the river. Whenever the native professor, from whom Dr. Bastian took lessons in Burmese at Mandalay, had his head washed, which took place as a rule once a month, he was generally absent for three days together, that time being consumed in preparing for, and recovering from, the operation of head-washing. Dr. Bastian's custom of washing his head daily gave rise to much remark.<a href="#note_852" id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a> The head of the king of Persia was cleaned only once a year, on his birthday.<a href="#note_853" id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a> Roman women washed their heads annually on the thirteenth of August, Diana's day.<a href="#note_854" id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> The Indians of Peru fancied they could rid themselves of their sins by scrubbing their heads with a small stone and then washing them in a stream.<a href="#note_855" id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a></p>

The houses are raised on posts above the ground, and whenever anything fell through the floor Dr. Bastian had always difficulty in persuading a servant to fetch it from under the house. In Rangoon a priest, summoned to the bedside of a sick man, climbed up a ladder and got in at the window rather than ascend the staircase, to reach which he must have passed under a gallery.

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the head was considered so sacred that it might not even be touched without grave offence, it is obvious that the cutting of the hair must have been a delicate and difficult operation. The difficulties and dangers which, on the primitive view, beset the operation are of two kinds. There is first the danger of disturbing the spirit of the head, which may be injured in the process and may revenge itself upon the person who molests him. Secondly, there is the difficulty of disposing of the shorn locks. For the savage believes that the sympathetic connexion which exists between himself and every part of his body continues to exist even after the physical connexion has been broken, and that therefore he will suffer from any harm that may befall the severed parts of his body, such as the clippings of his hair or the parings of his nails. Accordingly he takes care that these severed portions of himself shall not be left in places where they might either be exposed to accidental injury or fall into the hands of malicious persons who might work magic on them to his detriment or death. Such dangers are common to all, but sacred persons have more to fear from them than ordinary people, so the precautions taken by them are proportionately stringent. The simplest way of evading the peril is not to cut the hair at all; and this is the expedient adopted where the risk is thought to be more than usually great. The Frankish kings were never allowed to crop their hair; from their childhood upwards they had to keep it unshorn.<a href="#note_878" id="noteref_878" name="noteref_878"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> To poll the long locks that floated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg259" name="Pg259"/> on their shoulders would have been to renounce their right to the throne. When the wicked brothers Clotaire and Childebert coveted the kingdom of their dead brother Clodomir, they inveigled into their power their little nephews, the two sons of Clodomir; and having done so, they sent a messenger bearing scissors and a naked sword to the children's grandmother, Queen Clotilde, at Paris. The envoy shewed the scissors and the sword to Clotilde, and bade her choose whether the children should be shorn and live or remain unshorn and die. The proud queen replied that if her grandchildren were not to come to the throne she would rather see them dead than shorn. And murdered they were by their ruthless uncle Clotaire with his own hand.<a href="#note_879" id="noteref_879" name="noteref_879"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a> The king of Ponape, one of the Caroline Islands, must wear his hair long, and so must his grandees.<a href="#note_880" id="noteref_880" name="noteref_880"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">880</span></span></a> The hair of the Aztec priests hung down to their hams, so that the weight of it became very troublesome; for they might never poll it so long as they lived, or at least until they had been relieved of their office on the score of old age.

The chief of Namosi in Fiji always ate a man by way of precaution when he had had his hair cut. <span class="tei tei-q">โThere was a certain clan that had to provide the victim, and they used to sit in solemn council among themselves to choose him.

A subject tribe, whose town was some little distance from Namosi, had committed an unpardonable offence, and were condemned to a frightful doom. The earth-mound on which their temple had stood was planted with the mountain <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ndalo</span></span> (arum), and when the crop was ripe, the poor wretches had to carry it down to Namosi, and give at least one of their number to be killed and eaten by the chief. He used to take advantage of these occasions to have his hair cut, for the human sacrifice was supposed to avert all danger of witchcraft if any ill-wisher got hold of the cuttings of his hair, human hair being the most dangerous channel for the deadliest spells of the sorcerers. The stones round Rukunitambua represented these and other victims who had been killed and eaten at Namosi. Each stone was the record of a murder succeeded by a cannibal feast.โ</span><a href="#note_915" id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a> Amongst the Maoris many spells were uttered at hair-cutting; one, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg265" name="Pg265"/> example, was spoken to consecrate the obsidian knife with which the hair was cut; another was pronounced to avert the thunder and lightning which hair-cutting was believed to cause.<a href="#note_916" id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">โHe who has had his hair cut is in immediate charge of the Atua (spirit); he is removed from the contact and society of his family and his tribe; he dare not touch his food himself; it is put into his mouth by another person; nor can he for some days resume his accustomed occupations or associate with his fellow-men.โ</span><a href="#note_917" id="noteref_917" name="noteref_917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a> The person who cuts the hair is also tabooed; his hands having been in contact with a sacred head, he may not touch food with them or engage in any other employment; he is fed by another person with food cooked over a sacred fire.

The ceremony of shaving the top-knot takes place before the child has reached puberty, and great anxiety is felt at this time lest the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span>, or guardian-spirit who commonly resides in the body and especially the head of every Siamese,<a href="#note_922" id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> should be so disturbed by the tonsure as to depart and leave the child a hopeless wreck for life. Great pains are therefore taken to recall this mysterious being in case he should have fled, and to fix him securely in the child. This is the object of an elaborate ceremony performed on the afternoon of the day when the top-knot has been cut. A miniature pagoda is erected, and on it are placed several kinds of food known to be favourites of the spirit. When the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span> has arrived and is feasting on these dainties, he is caught and held fast under a cloth thrown over the food. The child is now placed near the pagoda, and all the family and friends form a circle, with the child, the captured spirit, and the Brahman priests in the middle. Hereupon the priests address the spirit, earnestly entreating him to enter into the child. They amuse him with tales, and coax and wheedle him with flattery, jest, and song; the gongs ring out their loudest; the people cheer and only a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span> of the sourest and most obdurate disposition could resist the combined appeal. The last sentences of the formal invocation run as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">โBenignant <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span>! Thou fickle being who art wont to wander and dally about! From the moment that the child was conceived in the womb, thou hast enjoyed every pleasure, until ten (lunar) months having elapsed and the time of delivery arrived, thou hast suffered and run the risk of perishing by being born alive into the world. Gracious <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span>! thou wast at that time so tender, delicate, and wavering as to cause great anxiety concerning thy fate; thou was exactly like a child, youthful, innocent, and inexperienced. The least trifle frightened thee and made thee shudder. In thy infantile playfulness thou wast wont to frolic and wander to no purpose. As thou didst commence to learn to sit, and, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg267" name="Pg267"/> unassisted, to crawl totteringly on all fours, thou wast ever falling flat on thy face or on thy back. As thou didst grow up in years and couldst move thy steps firmly, thou didst begin to run and sport thoughtlessly and rashly all round the rooms, the terrace, and bridging planks of travelling boat or floating house, and at times thou didst fall into the stream, creek, or pond, among the floating water-weeds, to the utter dismay of those to whom thy existence was most dear. O gentle <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span>, come into thy corporeal abode; do not delay this auspicious rite. Thou art now full-grown and dost form everybody's delight and admiration. Let all the tiny particles of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kwun</span></span> that have fallen on land or water assemble and take permanent abode in this darling little child.

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even when the hair and nails have been safely cut, there remains the difficulty of disposing of them, for their owner believes himself liable to suffer from any harm that may befall them. The notion that a man may be bewitched by means of the clippings of his hair, the parings of his nails, or any other severed portion of his person is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg268" name="Pg268"/> almost world-wide,<a href="#note_924" id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a> and attested by evidence too ample, too familiar, and too tedious in its uniformity to be here analysed at length. The general idea on which the superstition rests is that of the sympathetic connexion supposed to persist between a person and everything that has once been part of his body or in any way closely related to him. A very few examples must suffice. They belong to that branch of sympathetic magic which may be called contagious.<a href="#note_925" id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> Thus, when the Chilote Indians, inhabiting the wild, deeply indented coasts and dark rain-beaten forests of southern Chili, get possession of the hair of an enemy, they drop it from a high tree or tie it to a piece of seaweed and fling it into the surf; for they think that the shock of the fall, or the blows of the waves as the tress is tossed to and fro on the heaving billows, will be transmitted through the hair to the person from whose head it was cut.<a href="#note_926" id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> Dread of sorcery, we are told, formed one of the most salient characteristics of the Marquesan islanders in the old days. The sorcerer took some of the hair, spittle, or other bodily refuse of the man he wished to injure, wrapped it up in a leaf, and placed the packet in a bag woven of threads or fibres, which were knotted in an intricate way. The whole was then buried with certain rites, and thereupon the victim wasted away of a languishing sickness which lasted twenty days. His life, however, might be saved by discovering and digging up the buried hair, spittle, or what not; for as soon as this was done the power of the charm ceased.<a href="#note_927" id="noteref_927" name="noteref_927"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">927</span></span></a> A Marquesan chief told Lieutenant Gamble that he was extremely ill, the Happah tribe having stolen a lock of his hair and buried it in a plantain leaf for the purpose of taking his life. Lieutenant Gamble argued with him, but in vain; die he must unless the hair and the plantain leaf were brought back to him; and to obtain them he had offered the Happahs the greater part of his property. He complained of excessive <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg269" name="Pg269"/> pain in the head, breast, and sides.<a href="#note_928" id="noteref_928" name="noteref_928"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">928</span></span></a> A Maori sorcerer intent on bewitching somebody sought to get a tress of his victim's hair, the parings of his nails, some of his spittle, or a shred of his garment. Having obtained the object, whatever it was, he chanted certain spells and curses over it in a falsetto voice and buried it in the ground. As the thing decayed, the person to whom it had belonged was supposed to waste away.<a href="#note_929" id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a> Again, an Australian girl, sick of a fever, laid the blame of her illness on a young man who had come behind her and cut off a lock of her hair; she was sure he had buried it and that it was rotting. <span class="tei tei-q">โHer hair,โ</span> she said, <span class="tei tei-q">โwas rotting somewhere, and her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Marm-bu-la</span></span> (kidney fat) was wasting away, and when her hair had completely rotted, she would die.โ</span><a href="#note_930" id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a> When an Australian blackfellow wishes to get rid of his wife, he cuts off a lock of her hair in her sleep, ties it to his spear-thrower, and goes with it to a neighbouring tribe, where he gives it to a friend.

According as the sorcerer desires the death or only the sickness of his victim he leaves the bone in the midst of the fire or removes it and lays it in the sun. When he thinks he has done his enemy enough harm, he places the bone in water, which ends the enchantment.<a href="#note_933" id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg270" name="Pg270"/> Lucian describes how a Syrian witch professed to bring back a faithless lover to his forsaken fair one by means of a lock of his hair, his shoes, his garments, or something of that sort. She hung the hair, or whatever it was, on a peg and fumigated it with brimstone, sprinkling salt on the fire and mentioning the names of the lover and his lass. Then she drew a magic wheel from her bosom and set it spinning, while she gabbled a spell full of barbarous and fearsome words. This soon brought the false lover back to the feet of his charmer.<a href="#note_934" id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a> Apuleius tells how an amorous Thessalian witch essayed to win the affections of a handsome Boeotian youth by similar means.

So, too, an Arab of Moab who pardons a murderer will sometimes cut off the man's hair and shave his chin before releasing him. Again, when two Moabite Arabs had got hold of a traitor who had revealed their plan of campaign to the enemy, they contented themselves with shaving completely one side of his head and his moustache on the other, after which they set him at liberty.<a href="#note_952" id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a> We can now, perhaps, understand why Hanun King of Ammon shaved off one-half of the beards of King David's messengers and cut off half their garments before he sent them back to their master.<a href="#note_953" id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> His intention, we may conjecture, was not simply to put a gross affront on the envoys.

But the possibility of their being so used depends upon the supposed sympathetic connexion between them and the man from whom they were severed. And if this sympathetic connexion still exists, clearly these severed portions cannot be destroyed without injury to the man.</p>

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before leaving this subject, on which I have perhaps dwelt too long, it may be well to call attention to the motive assigned for cutting a young child's hair in Rotti.<a href="#note_1021" id="noteref_1021" name="noteref_1021"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1021</span></span></a> In that island the first hair is regarded as a danger to the child, and its removal is intended to avert the danger. The reason of this may be that as a young child is almost universally supposed to be in a tabooed or dangerous state, it is necessary, in removing the taboo, to remove also the separable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg284" name="Pg284"/> parts of the child's body because they are infected, so to say, by the virus of taboo and as such are dangerous. The cutting of the child's hair would thus be exactly parallel to the destruction of the vessels which have been used by a tabooed person.<a href="#note_1022" id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> This view is borne out by a practice, observed by some Australians, of burning off part of a woman's hair after childbirth as well as burning every vessel which has been used by her during her seclusion.<a href="#note_1023" id="noteref_1023" name="noteref_1023"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1023</span></span></a> Here the burning of the woman's hair seems plainly intended to serve the same purpose as the burning of the vessels used by her; and as the vessels are burned because they are believed to be tainted with a dangerous infection, so, we must suppose, is also the hair. Similarly among the Latuka of central Africa, a woman is secluded for fourteen days after the birth of her child, and at the end of her seclusion her hair is shaved off and burnt.<a href="#note_1024" id="noteref_1024" name="noteref_1024"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1024</span></span></a> Again, we have seen that girls at puberty are strongly infected with taboo; hence it is not surprising to find that the Ticunas of Brazil tear out all the hair of girls at that period.<a href="#note_1025" id="noteref_1025" name="noteref_1025"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a> Once more, the father of twins in Uganda is tabooed for some time after the birth of the children, and during that time he may not dress his hair nor cut his finger nails. This state of taboo lasts until the next war breaks out. When the army is under orders to march, the father of twins has the whole of his body shaved and his nails cut. The shorn hair and the cut nails are then tied up in a ball, which the man takes with him to the war, together with the bark cloth he wore at the ceremonial dances after the birth of the twins. When he has killed a foe, he crams the ball into the dead man's mouth, ties the bark cloth round the neck of the corpse, and leaves them there on the battlefield.<a href="#note_1026" id="noteref_1026" name="noteref_1026"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1026</span></span></a> The ceremony appears to be intended to rid the man of the taint of taboo which may be supposed to adhere to his hair, nails, and the garment he wore. Hence we can understand the importance attached by many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg285" name="Pg285"/> peoples to the first cutting of a child's hair and the elaborate ceremonies by which the operation is accompanied.<a href="#note_1027" id="noteref_1027" name="noteref_1027"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1027</span></span></a> Again, we can understand why a man should poll his head after a journey.<a href="#note_1028" id="noteref_1028" name="noteref_1028"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1028</span></span></a> For we have seen that a traveller is often believed to contract a dangerous infection from strangers, and that, therefore, on his return home he is obliged to submit to various purificatory ceremonies before he is allowed to mingle freely with his own people.<a href="#note_1029" id="noteref_1029" name="noteref_1029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1029</span></span></a> On my hypothesis the polling of the hair is simply one of these purificatory or disinfectant ceremonies. Certainly this explanation applies to the custom as practised by the Bechuanas, for we are expressly told that <span class="tei tei-q">โthey cleanse or purify themselves after journeys by shaving their heads, etc., lest they should have contracted from strangers some evil by witchcraft or sorcery.โ</span><a href="#note_1030" id="noteref_1030" name="noteref_1030"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1030</span></span></a> The cutting of the hair after a vow may have the same meaning. It is a way of ridding the man of what has been infected by the dangerous state, whether we call it taboo, sanctity, or uncleanness (for all these are only different expressions for the same primitive conception), under which he laboured during the continuance of the vow. Still more clearly does the meaning of the practice come out in the case of mourners, who cut their hair and nails and use new vessels when the period of their mourning is at an end. This was done in ancient India, obviously for the purpose of purifying such persons from the dangerous influence of death and the ghost to which for a time they had been exposed.<a href="#note_1031" id="noteref_1031" name="noteref_1031"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1031</span></span></a> Among the Bodos and Dhimals of Assam, when a death has occurred, the family of the deceased is reckoned unclean for three days.

At Hierapolis no man might enter the great temple of Astarte on the same day on which he had seen a corpse; next day he might enter, provided he had first purified himself. But the kinsmen of the deceased were not allowed to set foot in the sanctuary for thirty days after the death, and before doing so they had to shave their heads.<a href="#note_1033" id="noteref_1033" name="noteref_1033"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1033</span></span></a> At Agweh, on the Slave Coast of West Africa, widows and widowers at the end of their period of mourning wash themselves, shave their heads, pare their nails, and put on new cloths; and the old cloths, the shorn hair, and the nail-parings are all burnt.<a href="#note_1034" id="noteref_1034" name="noteref_1034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1034</span></span></a> The Kayans of Borneo are not allowed to cut their hair or shave their temples during the period of mourning; but as soon as the mourning is ended by the ceremony of bringing home a newly severed human head, the barber's knife is kept busy enough.

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same fear of witchcraft which has led so many people to hide or destroy their loose hair and nails has induced other or the same people to treat their spittle in a like fashion. For on the principles of sympathetic magic the spittle is part of the man, and whatever is done to it will have a corresponding effect on him. A Chilote Indian, who has gathered up the spittle of an enemy, will put it in a potato, and hang the potato in the smoke, uttering certain spells as he does so in the belief that his foe will waste away as the potato dries in the smoke. Or he will put the spittle in a frog and throw the animal into an inaccessible, unnavigable river, which will make the victim quake and shake with ague.<a href="#note_1041" id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a> When a Cherokee sorcerer desires to destroy a man, he gathers up his victim's spittle on a stick and puts it in a joint of wild parsnip, together with seven earthworms beaten to a paste and several splinters from a tree which has been struck by lightning.

Further, he lays seven yellow stones in the hole, then fills in the earth, and makes a fire over the spot to destroy all traces of his work.

To begin with knots, many people in different parts of the world entertain a strong objection to having any knot about their person at certain critical seasons, particularly childbirth, marriage, and death. Thus among the Saxons of Transylvania, when a woman is in travail all knots on her garments are untied, because it is believed that this will facilitate her delivery, and with the same intention all the locks in the house, whether on doors or boxes, are unlocked.<a href="#note_1076" id="noteref_1076" name="noteref_1076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1076</span></span></a> The Lapps think that a lying-in woman should have no knot on her garments, because a knot would have the effect of making the delivery difficult and painful.<a href="#note_1077" id="noteref_1077" name="noteref_1077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1077</span></span></a> In ancient India it was a rule to untie all knots in a house at the moment of childbirth.<a href="#note_1078" id="noteref_1078" name="noteref_1078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a> Roman religion required that women who took part in the rites of Juno Lucina, the goddess of childbirth, should have no knot tied on their persons.<a href="#note_1079" id="noteref_1079" name="noteref_1079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1079</span></span></a> In the East Indies this superstition is extended to the whole time of pregnancy; the people believe that if a pregnant woman were to tie knots, or braid, or make anything fast, the child would thereby be constricted or the woman would herself be <span class="tei tei-q">โtied upโ</span> when her time came.<a href="#note_1080" id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a> Nay, some of them enforce the observance of the rule on the father as well as the mother of the unborn child.

						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these cases the idea seems to be that the tying of a knot would, as they say in the East Indies, <span class="tei tei-q">โtie upโ</span> the woman, in other words, impede and perhaps prevent her delivery, or delay her convalescence after the birth. On the principles of homoeopathic or imitative magic the physical obstacle or impediment of a knot on a cord would create a corresponding obstacle or impediment in the body of the woman. That this is really the explanation of the rule appears from a custom observed by the Hos of Togoland in West Africa at a difficult birth. When a woman is in hard labour and cannot bring forth, they call in a magician to her aid. He looks at her and says, <span class="tei tei-q">โThe child is bound in the womb, that is why she cannot be delivered.โ</span> On the entreaties of her female relations he then promises to loose the bond so that she may bring forth. For that purpose he orders them to fetch a tough creeper from the forest, and with it he binds the hands and feet of the sufferer on her back. Then he takes a knife and calls out the woman's name, and when she answers he cuts through the creeper with a knife, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">โI cut through to-day thy bonds and thy child's bonds.โ</span> After that he chops up the creeper small, puts the bits in a vessel of water, and bathes the woman with the water.<a href="#note_1085" id="noteref_1085" name="noteref_1085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1085</span></span></a> Here the cutting of the creeper with which the woman's hands and feet are bound is a simple piece of homoeopathic or imitative magic: by releasing her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg296" name="Pg296"/> limbs from their bonds the magician imagines that he simultaneously releases the child in her womb from the trammels which impede its birth. For a similar reason, no doubt, among the same people a priest ties up the limbs of a pregnant woman with grass and then unties the knots, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">โI will now open you.โ</span> After that the woman has to partake of some maize-porridge in which a ring made of a magic cord had been previously placed by the priest.<a href="#note_1086" id="noteref_1086" name="noteref_1086"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1086</span></span></a> The intention of this ceremony is probably, on the principles of homoeopathic magic, to ensure for the woman an easy delivery by releasing her from the bonds of grass. The same train of thought underlies a practice observed by some peoples of opening all locks, doors, and so on, while a birth is taking place in the house. We have seen that at such a time the Germans of Transylvania open all the locks, and the same thing is done also in Voigtland and Mecklenburg.<a href="#note_1087" id="noteref_1087" name="noteref_1087"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1087</span></span></a> In north-western Argyllshire superstitious people used to open every lock in the house at childbirth.<a href="#note_1088" id="noteref_1088" name="noteref_1088"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1088</span></span></a> The old Roman custom of presenting women with a key as a symbol of an easy delivery<a href="#note_1089" id="noteref_1089" name="noteref_1089"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1089</span></span></a> perhaps points to the observance of a similar custom.

Of this important truth the Romans were fully aware. To sit beside a pregnant woman or a patient under medical treatment with clasped hands, says the grave Pliny, is to cast a malignant spell over the person, and it is worse still if you nurse your leg or legs with your clasped hands, or lay one leg over the other. Such postures were regarded by the old Romans as a let and hindrance to business of every sort, and at a council of war or a meeting of magistrates, at prayers and sacrifices, no man was suffered to cross his legs or clasp his hands.<a href="#note_1101" id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a> The stock instance of the dreadful consequences that might flow from doing one or the other was that of Alcmena, who travailed with Hercules for seven days and seven nights, because the goddess Lucina sat in front of the house with clasped hands <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg299" name="Pg299"/> and crossed legs, and the child could not be born until the goddess had been beguiled into changing her attitude.<a href="#note_1102" id="noteref_1102" name="noteref_1102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1102</span></span></a> It is a Bulgarian superstition that if a pregnant woman is in the habit of sitting with crossed legs, she will suffer much in childbed.<a href="#note_1103" id="noteref_1103" name="noteref_1103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1103</span></span></a> In some parts of Bavaria, when conversation comes to a standstill and silence ensues, they say, <span class="tei tei-q">โSurely somebody has crossed his legs.โ</span><a href="#note_1104" id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a></p>

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The magical effect of knots in trammelling and obstructing human activity was believed to be manifested at marriage not less than at birth. During the Middle Ages, and down to the eighteenth century, it seems to have been commonly held in Europe that the consummation of marriage could be prevented by any one who, while the wedding ceremony was taking place, either locked a lock or tied a knot in a cord, and then threw the lock or the cord away. The lock or the knotted cord had to be flung into water; and until it had been found and unlocked, or untied, no real union of the married pair was possible.<a href="#note_1105" id="noteref_1105" name="noteref_1105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1105</span></span></a> Hence it was a grave offence, not only to cast such a spell, but also to steal or make away with the material instrument of it, whether lock or knotted cord.

When the ceremony was over, and the bridal party had left the church, the bridegroom immediately retired one way with some young men to tie the knots that had been loosed a little before; and the bride in like manner withdrew somewhere else to adjust the disorder of her dress.<a href="#note_1107" id="noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> In some parts of the Highlands it was deemed enough that the bridegroom's left shoe should be without buckle or latchet, <span class="tei tei-q">โto prevent witches from depriving him, on the nuptial night, of the power of loosening the virgin zone.โ</span><a href="#note_1108" id="noteref_1108" name="noteref_1108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a> We meet with the same superstition and the same custom at the present day in Syria. The persons who help a Syrian bridegroom to don his wedding garments take care that no knot is tied on them and no button buttoned, for they believe that a button buttoned or a knot tied would put it within the power of his enemies to deprive him of his nuptial rights by magical means.<a href="#note_1109" id="noteref_1109" name="noteref_1109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1109</span></span></a> In Lesbos the malignant person who would thus injure a bridegroom on his wedding day ties a thread to a bush, while he utters imprecations; but the bridegroom can defeat the spell by wearing at his girdle a piece of an old net or of an old mantilla belonging to the bride in which knots have been tied.<a href="#note_1110" id="noteref_1110" name="noteref_1110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1110</span></span></a> The fear of such charms is diffused all over North Africa at the present day. To render a bridegroom impotent the enchanter has only to tie a knot in a handkerchief which he had previously placed quietly on some part of the bridegroom's body when he was mounted on horseback ready to fetch his bride: so long as the knot in the handkerchief <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg301" name="Pg301"/> remains tied, so long will the bridegroom remain powerless to consummate the marriage. Another way of effecting the same object is to stand behind the bridegroom when he is on horseback, with an open clasp-knife or pair of scissors in your hand and to call out his name; if he imprudently answers, you at once shut the clasp-knife or the pair of scissors with a snap, and that makes him impotent. To guard against this malignant spell the bridegroom's mother will sometimes buy a penknife on the eve of the marriage, shut it up, and then open it just at the moment when her son is about to enter the bridal chamber.<a href="#note_1111" id="noteref_1111" name="noteref_1111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a></p>

					</div>
					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious use is made of knots at marriage in the little East Indian island of Rotti. When a man has paid the price of his bride, a cord is fastened round her waist, if she is a maid, but not otherwise. Nine knots are tied in the cord, and in order to make them harder to unloose, they are smeared with wax. Bride and bridegroom are then secluded in a chamber, where he has to untie the knots with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand only. It may be from one to twelve months before he succeeds in undoing them all. Until he has done so he may not look on the woman as his wife. In no case may the cord be broken, or the bridegroom would render himself liable to any fine that the bride's father might choose to impose. When all the knots are loosed, the woman is his wife, and he shews the cord to her father, and generally presents his wife with a golden or silver necklace instead of the cord.<a href="#note_1112" id="noteref_1112" name="noteref_1112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a> The meaning of this custom is not clear, but we may conjecture that the nine knots refer to the nine months of pregnancy, and that miscarriage would be the supposed result of leaving a single knot untied.</p>

He goes on to relate how, once upon a time, a wicked Jew bewitched the prophet Mohammed himself by tying nine knots on a string, which he then hid in a well. So the prophet fell ill, and nobody knows what might have happened if the archangel Gabriel had not opportunely revealed to the holy man the place where the knotted cord was concealed. The trusty Ali soon fetched the baleful thing from the well; and the prophet recited over it certain charms, which were specially revealed to him for the purpose. At every verse of the charms a knot untied itself, and the prophet experienced a certain relief.<a href="#note_1116" id="noteref_1116" name="noteref_1116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1116</span></span></a> It will hardly be disputed that by tying knots on the string the pestilent Hebrew contrived, if I may say so, to constrict or astringe or, in short, to tie up some vital organ or organs in the prophet's stomach. At least we are informed that something of this sort is done by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303" name="Pg303"/> Australian blackfellows at the present day, and if so, why should it not have been done by Arabs in the time of Mohammed? The Australian mode of operation is as follows. When a blackfellow wishes to settle old scores with another blackfellow, he ties a rope of fibre or bark so tightly round the neck of his slumbering friend as partially to choke him. Having done this he takes out the man's caul-fat from under his short rib, ties up his inside carefully with string, replaces the skin, and having effaced all external marks of the wound, makes off with the stolen fat. The victim on awakening feels no inconvenience, but sooner or later, sometimes months afterwards, while he is hunting or exerting himself violently in some other way, he will feel the string snap in his inside. <span class="tei tei-q">โHallo,โ</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">โsomebody has tied me up inside with string!โ</span> and he goes home to the camp and dies on the spot.<a href="#note_1117" id="noteref_1117" name="noteref_1117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1117</span></span></a> Who can doubt but that in this lucid diagnosis we have the true key to the prophet's malady, and that he too might have succumbed to the wiles of his insidious foe if it had not been for the timely intervention of the archangel Gabriel?</p>

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If knots are supposed to kill, they are also supposed to cure. This follows from the belief that to undo the knots which are causing sickness will bring the sufferer relief. But apart from this negative virtue of maleficent knots, there are certain beneficent knots to which a positive power of healing is ascribed. Pliny tells us that some folk cured diseases of the groin by taking a thread from a web, tying seven or nine knots on it, and then fastening it to the patient's groin; but to make the cure effectual it was necessary to name some widow as each knot was tied.<a href="#note_1118" id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a> The ancient Assyrians seem to have made much use of knotted cords as a remedy for ailments and disease. The cord with its knots, which were sometimes twice seven in number, was tied round the head, neck, or limbs of the patient, and then after a time cut off and thrown away, carrying with it, as was apparently supposed, the aches and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg304" name="Pg304"/> pains of the sufferer. Sometimes the magic cord which was used for this beneficent purpose consisted of a double strand of black and white wool; sometimes it was woven of the hair of a virgin kid.<a href="#note_1119" id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a> A modern Arab cure for fever reported from the ruins of Nineveh is to tie a cotton thread with seven knots on it round the wrist of the patient, who must wear it for seven or eight days or till such time as the fever passes, after which he may throw it away.<a href="#note_1120" id="noteref_1120" name="noteref_1120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1120</span></span></a> O'Donovan describes a similar remedy for fever employed among the Turcomans. The enchanter takes some camel hair and spins it into a stout thread, droning a spell the while. Next he ties seven knots on the thread, blowing on each knot before he pulls it tight. This knotted thread is then worn as a bracelet on his wrist by the patient. Every day one of the knots is untied and blown upon, and when the seventh knot is undone the whole thread is rolled up into a ball and thrown into a river, bearing away (as they imagine) the fever with it.<a href="#note_1121" id="noteref_1121" name="noteref_1121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1121</span></span></a> The Hos of Togoland in like manner tie strings round a sick man's neck, arms, or legs, according to the nature of the malady; some of the strings are intended to guard him against the influence of <span class="tei tei-q">โthe evil mouthโ</span>; others are a protection against the ghosts of the dead.<a href="#note_1122" id="noteref_1122" name="noteref_1122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a> In Argyleshire, threads with three knots on them are still used to cure the internal ailments of man and beast.

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Russia amulets often derive their protective virtue in great measure from knots.

For a similar purpose the bridegroom and his companions are often girt with pieces of net, or at least with tight-drawn girdles, for before a wizard can begin to injure them he must undo all the knots in the net, or take off the girdles. But often a Russian amulet is merely a knotted thread. A skein of red wool wound about the arms and legs is thought to ward off agues and fevers; and nine skeins, fastened round a child's neck, are deemed a preservative against scarlatina. In the Tver Government a bag of a special kind is tied to the neck of the cow which walks before the rest of a herd, in order to keep off wolves; its force binds the maw of the ravening beast. On the same principle, a padlock is carried thrice round a herd of horses before they go afield in the spring, and the bearer locks and unlocks it as he goes, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">โI lock from my herd the mouths of the grey wolves with this steel lock.โ</span> After the third round the padlock is finally locked, and then, when the horses have gone off, it is hidden away somewhere till late in the autumn, when the time comes for the drove to return to winter quarters.

But in general we may say that in all the cases we have been considering the leading characteristic of the magic knot or lock is that, in strict accordance with its physical nature, it always acts as an impediment, hindrance, or obstacle, and that its influence is maleficent or beneficent according as the thing which it impedes or hinders is good or evil.

This connexion of ideas comes out clearly in a passage of Ovid, who bids a pregnant woman loosen her hair before she prays to the goddess of childbirth, in order that the goddess may gently loose her teeming womb.<a href="#note_1153" id="noteref_1153" name="noteref_1153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1153</span></span></a> It is less easy to say why on certain solemn occasions it appears to have been customary with some people to go with one shoe off and one shoe on. The forlorn hope of two hundred men who, on a dark and stormy night, stole out of Plataea, broke through the lines of the besieging Spartans, and escaped from the doomed city, were shod on the left foot only. The historian who records the fact assumes that the intention was to prevent their feet from slipping in the mud.<a href="#note_1154" id="noteref_1154" name="noteref_1154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1154</span></span></a> But if so, why were not both feet unshod or shod? What is good for the one foot is surely good for the other. The peculiar attire of the Plataeans on this occasion had probably nothing to do with the particular state of the ground and the weather at the time when they made their desperate sally, but was an old custom, a form of consecration or devotion, observed by men in any great hazard or grave emergency. Certainly the costume appears to have been regularly worn by some fighting races in antiquity, at least when they went forth to battle. Thus we are told that all the Aetolians were shod only on one foot, <span class="tei tei-q">โbecause they were so warlike,โ</span><a href="#note_1155" id="noteref_1155" name="noteref_1155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1155</span></span></a> and Virgil represents some of the rustic militia of ancient Latium as marching to war, their right feet shod in boots of raw hide, while their left feet were bare.<a href="#note_1156" id="noteref_1156" name="noteref_1156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1156</span></span></a> An oracle warned Pelias, king of Iolcus, to beware of the man with one sandal, and when Jason arrived with a sandal on his right foot but with his left foot bare, the king recognised the hand of fate.

The rule is not mentioned by ancient writers, but may be inferred from a scene painted on a Greek vase, where a man, naked except for a fillet round his head, is seen crouching on the skin of a sacrificial victim, his bare right foot resting on the skin, while his left foot, shod in a rough boot, is planted on the ground in front of him. Round about women with torches and vessels are engaged in performing ceremonies of purification over him.<a href="#note_1159" id="noteref_1159" name="noteref_1159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1159</span></span></a> When Dido in Virgil, deserted by Aeneas, has resolved to die, she feigns to perform certain magical rites which will either win back her false lover or bring relief to her wounded heart.

Thus when the young Lebid appeared at the Court of Norman to denounce the Absites, he anointed the hair of his head on one side only, let his garment hang down loosely, and wore but one shoe. This, we are told, was the costume regularly adopted by certain poets on such occasions.<a href="#note_1161" id="noteref_1161" name="noteref_1161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1161</span></span></a></p>

						</div>
					</div>
					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus various peoples seem to be of opinion that it stands a man in good stead to go with one foot shod and one foot bare on certain momentous occasions. But why? The explanation must apparently be sought in the magical virtue attributed to knots; for down to recent times, we may take it, shoes have been universally tied to the feet by latchets. Now the magical action of a knot, as we have seen, is supposed to be to bind and restrain not merely the body but the soul,<a href="#note_1162" id="noteref_1162" name="noteref_1162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1162</span></span></a> and this action is beneficial or harmful according as the thing which is bound and restrained is evil or good. It is a necessary corollary of this doctrine that to be without knots is to be free and untrammelled, which, by the way, may be the reason why the augur's staff at Rome had to be made from a piece of wood in which there was no knot;<a href="#note_1163" id="noteref_1163" name="noteref_1163"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1163</span></span></a> it would never do for a divining rod to be spell-bound. Hence we may suppose that the intention of going with one shoe on and one shoe off is both to restrain and to set at liberty, to bind and to unbind. But to bind or unbind whom or what? Perhaps the notion is to rid the man himself of magical restraint, but to lay it on his foe, or at all events on his foe's magic; in short, to bind his enemy by a spell while he himself goes free. This is substantially the explanation which the acute and learned Servius gives of Dido's costume. He says that she went with one shoe on and one shoe off in order that Aeneas might be entangled and herself released.<a href="#note_1164" id="noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a> An analogous explanation would obviously apply to all the other cases we have considered, for in all of them the man who wears this peculiar costume is confronted with hostile powers, whether human or supernatural, which it must be his object to lay under a ban.</p>

The custom was observed at the Greek festival of the Thesmophoria,<a href="#note_1181" id="noteref_1181" name="noteref_1181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1181</span></span></a> and at the Athenian festival of Dionysus in the city.<a href="#note_1182" id="noteref_1182" name="noteref_1182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a> At the great festival of the Dassera, celebrated in October by the Goorkhas of Nepaul, all the law courts are closed, and all prisoners in gaol are removed from the precincts of the city; but those who are imprisoned outside the city do not have to change their place of confinement at the time of the Dassera.<a href="#note_1183" id="noteref_1183" name="noteref_1183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1183</span></span></a> This Nepaulese custom appears strongly to support the explanation here suggested of such gaol-deliveries. For observe that the prisoners are not released, but merely removed from the city. The intention is therefore not to allow them to share the general happiness, but merely to rid the city of their inopportune presence at the festival.</p>

					<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before quitting the subject of knots I may be allowed to hazard a conjecture as to the meaning of the famous Gordian knot, which Alexander the Great, failing in his efforts to untie it, cut through with his sword. In Gordium, the ancient capital of the kings of Phrygia, there was preserved a waggon of which the yoke was fastened to the pole by a strip of cornel-bark or a vine-shoot twisted and tied in an intricate knot. Tradition ran that the waggon had been dedicated by Midas, the first king of the dynasty, and that whoever untied the knot would be ruler of Asia.<a href="#note_1184" id="noteref_1184" name="noteref_1184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1184</span></span></a> Perhaps <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg317" name="Pg317"/> the knot was a talisman with which the fate of the dynasty was believed to be bound up in such a way that whenever the knot was loosed the reign of the dynasty would come to an end. We have seen that the magic virtue ascribed to knots is naturally enough supposed to last only so long as they remain untied. If the Gordian knot was the talisman of the Phrygian kings, the local fame it enjoyed, as guaranteeing to them the rule of Phrygia, might easily be exaggerated by distant rumour into a report that the sceptre of Asia itself would fall to him who should undo the wondrous knot.<a href="#note_1185" id="noteref_1185" name="noteref_1185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1185</span></span></a></p>
