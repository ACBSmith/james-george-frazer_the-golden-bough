			<h3 epub:type="title">Preface to the Second Edition</h3>
			<p>In this second edition some minor corrections have been made and some fresh matter added. Where my views appear to have been misunderstood, I have endeavoured to state them more clearly; where they have been disputed, I have carefully reconsidered the evidence and given my reasons for adhering to my former opinions. Most of the additions thus made to the volume are comprised in a new chapter (<span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Men and Women”</span>), a new section (<span class="tei tei-q">“Influence of Mother-kin on Religion”</span>), and three new appendices (<span class="tei tei-q">“Moloch the King,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Widowed Flamen,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Some Customs of the Pelew Islanders”</span>). Among the friends and correspondents who have kindly helped me with information and criticisms of various sorts I wish to thank particularly <abbr>Mr.</abbr> W. Crooke, Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> G. F. Hill of the British Museum, the Reverend J. Roscoe of the Church Missionary Society, and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> W. Wyse. Above all I owe much to my teacher the Reverend Professor R. H. Kennett, who, besides initiating me into the charms of the Hebrew language and giving me a clearer insight into the course of Hebrew history, has contributed several valuable suggestions to the book and enhanced the kindness by reading and criticizing some of the proofs.</p>
