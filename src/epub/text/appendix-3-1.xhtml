					<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear Lord Avebury</span> —As the result of enquiries I hear from a <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Eames, a lawyer who practised for some years at Shanghai and has considerable knowledge of Chinese matters, that for a small sum a substitute can be found for execution. This is recognised by the Chinese authorities, with certain exceptions, as for instance parricide. It is even asserted that the local Taotai gains pecuniarily by this arrangement, as he is as a rule not above obtaining a substitute for the condemned man for a less sum than was paid him by the latter.</p>
					<p>It is, I believe, part of the doctrine of Confucius that it is one of the highest virtues to increase the family prosperity at the expense of personal suffering. According to Eames, the Chinamen [<i>sic</i>] looks upon execution in another man’s stead in this light, and consequently there is quite a competition for such a “substitution.”</p>
					<p>Should you wish to get more definite information, the address is: <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Eames, <abbr>Esq.</abbr>, ℅ Norman Craig, Inner Temple, <abbr class="eoc">E.C.</abbr></p>
					<p>The only man in this department who has actually been out to China is at present away. But on his return I will ask him about it.⁠— <span epub:type="z3998:valediction">Yours sincerely,</span></p>

				<p>On this subject Lord Avebury had stated: “It is said that in China, if a rich man is condemned to death, he can sometimes purchase a willing substitute at a very small expense.”<a href="endnotes-3.xhtml#note-3-726" id="noteref-3-726" epub:type="noteref">726</a> In regard to his authority for this statement Lord Avebury wrote to me (August 10, 1903): “I believe my previous information came from Sir <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Wade, but I have been unable to lay my hand on his letter, and do not therefore like to state it as a fact.” Sir Thomas Wade was English Ambassador at Peking, and afterwards Professor of Chinese at Cambridge.</p>
				<p>On the same subject <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Valentine Chirol, editor of the foreign department of <i>The Times</i>, wrote to me as follows:⁠—</p>

					<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear Sir</span> —I shall be very glad to do what I can to obtain for you the information you require. It was a surprise to me to hear that the accuracy of the statement was called in question. It is certainly a matter of common report in China that the practice exists. The difficulty, I conceive, will be to obtain evidence enabling one to quote concrete cases. My own impression is that the practice is quite justifiable according to Chinese ethics when life is given up from motives of filial piety, that is to say in order to relieve the wants of indigent parents, or to defray the costs of ancestral rights [<i>sic</i>]. Your general thesis that life is less valued and more readily sacrificed by some races than by modern Europeans seems to be beyond dispute. Surely the Japanese practice of <i xml:lang="ja">sepuku</i>, or <i xml:lang="ja">harikari</i> , as it is vulgarly called, is a case in point. Life is risked, as in duelling, by Europeans, for the mere point of honour, but it is never deliberately laid down in satisfaction of the exigencies of the social code. I will send you whatever information I can obtain when it reaches me, but that will not of course be for some months.⁠—<span epub:type="z3998:valediction">Yours truly</span>,</p>

He has promised to look up some of these <abbr>Impe.</abbr> Decrees on his return to China, and send me translations. I am satisfied personally that his statement is conclusive.</p>

				<p>On the same subject I have received the following letter from <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. O. P.</abbr> Bland, for fourteen years correspondent of <i>The Times</i> in China:⁠—</p>

					<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear Professor Frazer</span> —My friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Valentine Chirol, writing the other day from Crete on his way East, asked me to communicate with you on the subject of your letter of the 3rd <abbr>ultro.</abbr>, namely, the custom, alleged to exist in China, of procuring substitutes for persons condemned to death, the substitutes’ families or relatives receiving compensation in cash.</p>
					<p>To speak of this as a custom is to exaggerate the frequency of a class of incident which has undoubtedly been recorded in China and of which there has been mention in Imperial Decrees. I am sorry to say that I have not my file of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Peking Gazette</i> here, for immediate reference, but I am writing to my friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Backhouse in Peking, and have no doubt but that he will be able to give chapter and verse of instances thus recorded. I had expected to find cases of the kind recorded in <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Werner’s recently-published “Descriptive Sociology” of the Chinese (Spencerian publications), but have not been able to do so in the absence of an index to that voluminous work. More than one of the authors whom he quotes have certainly referred to cases of substitution for death-sentence prisoners. Parker, for instance (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">China Past and Present,</i> page 378), asserts that substitutes were to be had in Canton at the reasonable price of fifty taels (say £10). <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Matignon (in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Superstition, Crime et Misère en Chine</i>,page 113) says that filial piety is a frequent motive. The negative opinion of Professors Giles and de Groot is entitled to consideration, but cannot be regarded as any more conclusive than the views expressed by Professor Giles on the question of infanticide which are outweighed by a mass of direct proof of eyewitnesses.</p>
					<p>In a country where men submit voluntarily to mutilation and grave risk of death for a comparatively small gain to themselves and their relatives, where women commit suicide in hundreds to escape capture by invaders or strangers, where men and women alike habitually sacrifice their life for the most trivial motives of revenge or distress, it need not greatly surprise us that some should be found, especially among the wretchedly poor class, willing to give up their life in order to relieve their families of want or otherwise to “acquire merit.”</p>
					<p>The most important thing, I think, in expressing any opinion about the Chinese, is to remember the great extent and heterogeneous elements of the country, and to abstain from any sweeping generalisations based on isolated acts or events.⁠—<span epub:type="z3998:valediction">Yours truly</span>,</p>

				<p>As the practice in question involves a grave miscarriage of justice, the discovery of which might entail serious consequences on the magistrate who connived at it, we need not wonder that it is generally hushed up, and that no instances of it should come to the ears of many Europeans resident in China. My friend Professor <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H. A.</abbr> Giles of Cambridge in conversation expressed himself quite incredulous on the subject, and Professor <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. J. M.</abbr> de Groot of Leyden wrote to me (January 31, 1902) to the same effect. The <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. T. A.</abbr> Barber, Headmaster of the Leys School, Cambridge, and formerly a missionary in China, wrote to me (January 30, 1902): “As to the possibility that a man condemned to death may secure a substitute on payment of a moderate sum of money, we used to hear that this was the case; but I have no proof that would justify you in using the fact.” Another experienced missionary, the <abbr>Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. A.</abbr> Cornaby, wrote to <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Barber: “I have heard of no such custom in capital crimes. The man in whose house a fire starts may, and often does, pay another to receive the blows and three days in a cangue. But unless where ‘foreign riots’ were the case, and a previously condemned criminal handy, I should hardly think it possible. Every precaution is taken that no one is beheaded but the man who cannot possibly be let off. The expense on the county mandarin is over £100 in ‘stationery expenses’ with higher courts.” On this I would observe that if every execution costs the local mandarin so dear, he must be under a strong temptation to get the expenses out of the prisoner whenever he can do so without being detected.</p>
				<p>With regard to the custom, mentioned by <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Cornaby, of procuring substitutes for corporal punishment, we are told that in China there are men who earn a livelihood by being thrashed instead of the real culprits. But they bribe the executioner to lay on lightly; otherwise their constitution could not long resist the tear and wear of so exhausting a profession.<a href="endnotes-3.xhtml#note-3-727" id="noteref-3-727" epub:type="noteref">727</a> Thus the theory and practice of vicarious suffering are well understood in China.</p>
